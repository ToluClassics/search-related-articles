- [Scaling the Instagram Explore recommendations system](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/09/ml-applications/scaling-instagram-explore-recommendations-system/)<br>
  <b>Preview: Explore is one of the largest recommendation systems on Instagram.
We leverage machine learning to make sure people are always seeing content that is the most interesting and relevant to them.
Using more advanced machine learning models, like Two Towers neural networks, we’ve been able to make the Explore recommendation system even more scalable and flexible.</b>

- [Broad and Ambiguous Search Queries](https://dtunkelang.medium.com/broad-and-ambiguous-search-queries-1bbbe417dcc)<br>
  <b>Preview:A typical approach for processing search queries is to retrieve a set of matching documents and then rank them with a relevance scoring function. This simple approach generally works well for unambiguous, specific search queries.
But sometimes this approach breaks down. When a search query is broad (e.g., “shirts”), it isn’t clear how to decide which matching results are the most relevant ones.</b>

<b>Preview:</b> While storage feels almost infinite, and cheap, to boot, it does still cost money to store stopwords. Let’s consider a simple index. Each posting consumes 8 bytes for document ID, 4 bytes for position....

- [10 Reasons why you shouldn’t remove stop words](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2023/01/24/10-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-remove-stop-words/) <br>
  <b>Preview:</b> So there shouldn’t be any harm in removing them from the data we are indexing in search engines and from the queries that are sent to these to retrieve relevant results, right? ..

- [Ask like a human: Implementing semantic search on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/31/ask-like-a-human-implementing-semantic-search-on-stack-overflow/)<br>
  <b>Preview:Our hypothesis is that if our semantic search produces high-quality results, technologists looking for answers will use our search instead of a search engine or conversational AI. Our forthcoming semantic search functionality is the first step in a continuous experimental process that will involve a lot of data science, iteration, and most importantly: our users. We’re excited to embark upon this adventure together with our community and can’t wait for you to experience our new semantic search.</b>

- [Retrieval Augmented Generation: Streamlining the creation of intelligent natural language processing models](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/)<br>
  <b>Preview: RAG looks and acts like a standard seq2seq model, meaning it takes in one sequence and outputs a corresponding sequence. There is an intermediary step though, which differentiates and elevates RAG above the usual seq2seq methods. Rather than passing the input directly to the generator, RAG instead uses the input to retrieve a set of relevant documents, in our case from Wikipedia.</b>
